# Getting started

This page describes how to get started building an application with Fabric
React.

## Setting up your app

Ensure the [Fabric CSS](https://css.fabric-ds.io) stylesheet is loaded in the
page you are working on.

See the
[Fabric CSS getting started guide](https://css.fabric-ds.io/pages/getting-started.html)
for more information.

## Installation

All the Fabric React code is provided as a single package and each component can
be imported from this package.

### Install from NPM

The Fabric React package can be installed from NPM.

```shell
npm install @honk-ds/react
```

### Install from Eik

The same package is also available via our Eik CDN server

```html
https://assets.finn.no/pkg/honk-ds/react/v0/index.js
```

### Importing Components

Once installed, components can be imported into your app by name. Below are
examples of how thats done

<br />

#### Importing from the NPM package

ðŸ‘‰ _**This is the most common method and should be used in most cases**_

When importing from NPM you will need to ensure you have build tooling in place.
If you are working with Podium podlets or layouts which is the most common use
case at Finn, you likely already have Eik in place with Rollup or Esbuild in
which case no further action should be needed.

If not, take a look at the React
[getting started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) docs.

_Example_

```js
import { Button } from '@honk-ds/react';
```

<br />

#### Importing directly from Eik

ðŸ‘‰ _**This is great for prototyping (can also be used in production)**_

It is also possible to import components directly from the URL on our Eik
server. While not common, it should be possible to write React code without the
need for a build setup. You might find this useful for rapid prototyping
something on a hack day for example!

_Example_

```js
import { Button } from 'https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@honk-ds/react/v0/index.js';
```

If you go down this route, other dependencies such as React and React Dom will
also need to be imported via URLs. These can also be found on the Eik server.

_Example_

```js
import React from 'https://assets.finn.no/npm/@pika/react/v16/index.js';
import ReactDom from 'https://assets.finn.no/npm/@pika/react-dom/v16/index.js';
```

<br />

#### Individual component imports

You can find the specific import statement to import each component on that
component's documentation page. For example, here's the [button page](/button)

## TypeScript support

The components are written in TypeScript. To take advantage of this, make sure
your project is up to date on the latest `@types/react` definitions.

```shell
# YARN
yarn add @types/react -D

# NPM
npm i @types/react -D
```
